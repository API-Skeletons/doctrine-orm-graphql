This project provides a Doctrine ORM Driver to be used with
`GraphQL for PHP <https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php>`_.

You may choose which entities, fields, and associations in your object manager
are available for querying through GraphQL.  Filtering is provided for
entities and for all associated collections.

Pagination of collections is supported with
`GraphQL's Complete Connection Model <https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#complete-connection-model>`_.
