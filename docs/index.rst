This is the documentation for
`API-Skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql>`_

This project builds GraphQL types, filters, and resolvers for Doctrine entities.  To select which
entities, fields, and associations are available for querying via GraphQL,
PHP attributes are used.

The goal of this project is to make creating GraphQL types very simple, but as
you'll see, there's a lot of customizable power built in too.
