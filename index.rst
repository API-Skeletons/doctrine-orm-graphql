GraphQL Type Driver for Doctrine ORM
====================================

This is the documentation for
`API-Skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql <https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql>`_

This project builds GraphQL types for Doctrine entities.  To select which
entities, fields, and associations are available for querying via GraphQL,
PHP 8 attributes are used.

The goal of this project is to make creating GraphQL types very simple, but as
you'll see, there's a lot of customizable power built in too.
